# Scaffolding

This is the framework for dot file configuration, installation and maintence
that I use. It works across multiple operating systems and incorporates ideas
from some of the existing dot-file frameworks on github.

## Installation

Just run the `install.sh` script and everything will be taken care of. Back up
your existing dot files while you're trying this out.
